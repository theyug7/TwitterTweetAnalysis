"@ashleevance You could literally film a Walking Dead episode unedited in downtown SF.

This is where San Francisco politics leads and Twitter was exporting this self-destructive mind virus to the world.

With some exceptions, other tech companies are still doing so.

"@TitterDaily Avoiding dystopian outcomes is not easy. 

The intent is not for the algorithm to be some judgy moral arbiter, but rather that it do its best to inform &amp; entertain.

Trying to maximize unregretted user-minutes seems like the right objective."

@rowancheung The AI carousel spins ever faster
"Most of the recommendation algorithm will be made open source today. The rest will follow.

Acid test is that independent third parties should be able to determine, with reasonable accuracy, what will probably be shown to users.

@iheartmindy This deserves close scrutiny 🧐
@BillyM2k AI optimizing for the greatest understanding of the universe might be the right objective. Eliminating or stunting human civilization would reduce understanding.
@Jason Yeah
"@TwitterSafety Given that there are ~500 million tweets per day, making individual human review impossible, this is the most salient point.

One possible mitigation is a shorter suspension of 6 hours instead of 12."

"@TeslaDiva99 Tesla car temp is automatically kept within a safe range, even when the car appears “off”, in order to protect infants &amp; pets.

"Given that modern AI can solve any “prove you’re not a robot” tests, it’s now trivial to spin up 100k human-like bots for less than a penny per account.
